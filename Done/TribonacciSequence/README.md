# Tribonacci Sequence

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with `[1, 1, 1]` as a starting input (AKA *signature*), we have this sequence:

```python
[1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
```
